Peer Review - GREAT JOB!!! website is fully functional. I like the alert message that pops up when you remove a pokemon from you favorites, very nice touch. Here are some nitpicks though:
    -On Mobile and desktop the evolutions container has a slight scroll for the standard 3 pokemon evolution series. I would make the height of the container a tad bit bigger to avoid that in the usual cases. The scroll is of course a nice touch for long evolution chains like eevee so good job there.
    -Moves container should probably have a "Moves" header that doesn't scroll with the body

Overall impressive site
